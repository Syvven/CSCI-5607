# Computer Graphics I (CSCI 5607) -- Noah Hendrickson

This repository contains all code developed over the course of the Spring 2023 semester in Computer Graphics I at the University of Minnesota by myself. 
Projects include a raytracer with all self written code, various example images generated, and two homeworks as an introduction to OpenGL, affine transformations, and perspective transformations for camera control.

## Assignment 0:
Intro to PPM files. Program generates a PPM file of an image based on a number of input parameters. Options for image generation methods involve Voronoi Diagram, a SPH fluid simulation, Perlin Noise, and a basic gradient.

## Assignment 1a: 
Intro to the ray tracer, able to render simple, unshaded circles
