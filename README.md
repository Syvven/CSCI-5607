# Computer Graphics I (CSCI 5607) -- Noah Hendrickson

This repository contains all code developed over the course of the Spring 2023 semester in Computer Graphics I at the University of Minnesota by myself. 
Projects include a raytracer with all self written code, various example images generated, and two homeworks as an introduction to OpenGL, affine transformations, and perspective transformations for camera control.
